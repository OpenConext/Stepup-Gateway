This component is part of "Step-up Authentication as-a Service". See [Stepup-Deploy](https://github.com/OpenConext/Stepup-Deploy) for an overview and installation instructions for a complete Stepup system, including this component. The requirements and installation instructions below cover this component only.

## Requirements

 * PHP 7.2
 * [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
 * A web server (Apache, Nginx)
 * MariaDB 5.5+ (MySQL should work as well)
 * syslog (or change the logging configuration in /app/config/logging.yml)

## Installation

Clone the repository or download the archive to a directory. Install the dependencies by running `composer install && yarn install` and fill out the database credentials et cetera.

The Gateway is configured to only accept connections over SSL. Disable this under `nelmio_security` in `config.yml` or run the web server using a (self-signed) certificate.

## Developer options

### Mock Yubikey service
If you are not in possession of an actual Yubikey device, using the Mock Yubikey service might prove useful. This
mock service was created for end to end test purposes, but could be utilized in this situation. To use the mock service:

1. Update your `src/Surfnet/StepupGateway/ApiBundle/Resources/config/services.yml`
2. Find the `surfnet_gateway_api.service.yubikey` service
3. Update the service definition to point to this class: `class: Surfnet\StepupGateway\ApiBundle\Tests\TestDouble\Service\YubikeyService` 
4. Do not commit/push this change!
