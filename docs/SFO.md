# Second Factor Only (SFO) Authentication

Second Factor Only (SFO) Authentication exposes the second factor authentication of the Stepup-Gateway directly to an SP. This is different from the normal authentication offered by Stepup which always first authenticates the first factor of the user by contacting the Remote IdP.
